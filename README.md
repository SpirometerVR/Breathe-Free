CSCI 538 Spring 2020 Final CHLA Project Repository

### Project Description:
This project was built in partnership with Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA).
The overall goal of the project is to develop a VR application for children undergoing
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) therapy. 

The VR application's goal is to make CF therapy more engaging for children and increase
the therapy completion rate. The application consists of two mini games: Fruit World and Space Quest.


### Mini Games: 
#### Fruit World:
Fruit World is a VR game where the player tries to knock down as many fruits as possible. The game is 
set in a forest with varying types of fruit trees and greenery. The player inhales to collect stones 
and exhales to launch the stone towards a fruit they aim at. The player needs to continuously inhale for 
the target amount of time to collect the stone and needs to exhale for the target amount of time to launch 
it successfully and hit a fruit. The more fruits that the player knocks down, the more points they accumulate!

#### Space Quest:
Space Quest is a VR game where the player controls a spaceship using inhalation and exhalation. 
Their goal is to navigate safely through an asteroid field as they collect precious space gems from distant galaxies. 
The player will inhale to gather fuel and exhale to accelerate the ship. During the exhalation phase, the player will move 
through the asteroid field and collect rare space gems while avoiding any collisions along the way. The player 
will refuel the ship completely if they inhale for the target amount of time, but will only partially refuel the ship on 
an unsuccessful inhale attempt. The player will then use that fuel to collect the next set of gems that are spotted ahead; 
if the player did not inhale completely, the farthest gems will be too far away.
